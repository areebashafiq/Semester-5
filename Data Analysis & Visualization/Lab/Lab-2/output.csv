0,Alynis W,"I personally also love the Live Translate feature of the pixel buds pro. It's a niche feature but for those of us who will use it for travel or for business, its really nice."
1,Maxim Krivov,"Interesting, I found the touch volume controls working like magic for me sooooo smooth and spot on. Ignores accidental touches and always registers when I want to change the volume. Incredible."
2,Basim Newby,"Always a great review.  In regards to the swiping for volume...I found that with any ear buds to be able to reliably use gestures I would have to first put my thumb behind my earlobe this would completely stabilize my hand during and allowed me to perform any gesture (multi-taps, swiping, tap and hold) during any activity with complete accuracy everytime. I'm not sure why this isn't advertised as it really should be the way to use any earbuds gestures."
3,VeeTeeF,"The biggest restriction for me when it comes to buying earbuds is battery life. I wear 1 earbud (and occasionally the 2nd) basically my entire 9+ hour workday 5 days a week for listening to music/audiobooks/YouTube and for taking calls and joining meetings. Comfort is also a concern, but I haven't had much issue with most of the earbuds I've owned."
4,BrobaFett,"I really like the design, sound and battery life of these ear buds but getting the proper fit has been a pain. They stay in fine but they feel like they'll fall out easier than they should. And I didn't hear anything about the ANC but I feel like mine let in more sound then I'd like."
5,Buckminster II,"I've been using the Skullcandy Push Actives for a few months now, will say they're pretty good with base and do stick in my ears pretty well.
Still thinking of getting these though, I want a bit of an upgrade to audio and the noise cancelling on the push actives is rather dull, not to mention the transparency mode."
6,Neoxon,It feels like yesterday that we just lost the ability to use wired headphones. Now itâ€™s simply feels normal to look for wireless earbuds.
7,Bryan S,"I bought these without hesitation when they dropped and I absolutely love them. I had purchased the original Pixel Buds with the wingtips and I unfortunately had to return them because they were uncomfortable and painful. The new buds without the wingtips are great, and stay in my ear securely. I alternate between these and the OnePlus Buds Pro, though these have way better sound."
8,Brighton Graf,I loved the second gen pixel buds they worked perfectly with my pixel 3 like I have seen airpods work on iphone. BUT when I upgraded to a pixel 6 they had constant connection issues and I would have to constantly forget the device and reconnect also the touch sensor wasn't consistent. Support was no help saying it was a firmware update that would be coming to the buds and after months of the issue both batteries died in the headphones and they would last 30 mins max regardless of volume level. Basically experience was so bad I switched over to the Sonylinkbuds like a month ago and will never go back to Google earbuds because of how excited I was and how disappointed the experience ended up being
9,Eton *non fevrieat,"These improve in the areas I wanted most over the A-series I was using before, primarily battery life. I rarely use ANC so having 11 hours of non-ANC battery life means I can comfortably use them all workday and not worry about battery life."
10,Eric Davis,"Great review. Love when companies make useful, sensible and pragmatic upgrades."
11,Lee McLaren,"I was really looking forward to this review having the Google pixel 6 I thought these would work great. Unfortunately I'm not confident in the volume area as I use my earbuds a lot for travel where using the extra volume is needed.
But I think I'll keep my jabra elite 85t. Highly recommend these buds, only thing is they do get a little sore after a few hours of wearing. But I think this is an issue with all earbuds."
12,Tobu Jupaki,Microphone quality is where most of these things fall behind.  Looking forward to actual tests of these vs competition.
13,Ya Cube,"Marques, I loved the whole review but I'm curious as to how the microphone quality is on the Pixel Buds Pro? I attend calls using my earbuds and in some cases I'm outside or on the subway and public places so was just wondering how good may the microphone quality be?"
14,Edmund Huang,"When I first got these buds and paired them to my phone, the sound quality was really bad, it was very tinny. But then I updated the firmware and they sound much better.

Another point is the way they are wingless. At the very start, I had a hard time getting these in and out of the case and in my ears. But I've adapted to the shape of the buds and it's completely normal for me now."
15,Jeff Moses,Dude does the best reviews on the web. Quick to the point and hits all the important stuff
16,Kintuk chakravorty,"I personally feel my sony Xm4 is still the best in terms of battery life and Noise cancelation, also the sound quality is top notch."
17,Sir Green,"Finally, I've been waiting for this review. The battery life and sound quality on the Galaxy buds + has kept me satisfied. Definitely won't step down to less than the same 11 hrs of battery life (even if others may sound better). And I use a pixel so this should naturally be the next pair I buy right?"
18,Taofiki Gafar-Schaner,Bought these last week and I'm so happy! Multipoint is an underrated feature for those of us outside the Google ecosystem. Being able to be connected to my laptop and phone at the same time is nice. I have a pair of jabras but they didn't have great battery life. With that sale price. These are an easy choice
19,Jorge Linares,"Wavelet for EQ, 9 bands, super clean and works system-wide for Android 10 or higher. Activate legacy mode, works great. For gaming I'd turn it off since it does add a bit of latency as a pre-processor it also comes with a compressor/limiter and independent volume on the free version if you wanna tinker customize  Ohh and you can create an EQ for every single device you connect, including your built-in speakers."
